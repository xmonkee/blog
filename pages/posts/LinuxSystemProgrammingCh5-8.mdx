#### Chapter 5 - Processes

- A binary is a compiled blob of code
- A process is a running program, includes
  - the binary image
  - virtualized memory instance
  - kernel resources like open files
  - security context like user
  - one or more threads
  - a thread has a virtualized processor, stack, registers and instruction pointer
  - in a single threaded process, the process IS the thread
  - all threads share the same memory
- A process has a PID that's guaranteed to be unique _at a given moment_
- The _idle_ process has PID 0
- The first process is called the init process (pid 1)
- The kernel tries the following _init_ programs:
  - /sbin/init
  - /etc/init
  - /bin/init
  - /bin/sh
- The init process handles the remainder of the boot process, launching services and a login program
- The kernel keeps monotinically increasing the PID till it wraps around
- Every process (child) is spawned from another process (parent)
- Each process has a ppid(parent pid)
- Each process inherits the parent's UID and GID
- Processes belong to process groups. Normally children have the same group as the parent
- when you do a `ls | less` both `ls` and `less` will have the same process group
- to get your own pid:

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
// returns the process ID of the invoking process
pid_t getpid (void);
// returns the process ID of the invoking process’s parent
pid_t getppid (void);
// Neither call will return an error
printf ("My pid=%jd\n", (intmax_t) getpid ());
printf ("Parent's pid=%jd\n", (intmax_t) getppid ());
// intmax_t is guaranteed to be larger than any int on the system
```

##### Running processes

- `fork` creates a near duplicate of the parent process
- `exec` family of calls loads a binary into memory, replacing the previous program, and executes it
- to execute a new program, you have to fist `fork`, then `exec`

```c
#include <unistd.h>
int ret;
  ret = execl ("/bin/vi", "vi", "/home/kidd/hooks.txt", NULL);
  // Arguments must be NULL terminated
  if (ret == −1)
    perror ("execl");
```

- normally, execl does not return since there's nothing to return to
- it clears out most attributes of the calling process including signals and locks
- it keeps the open file ids. They should be either manually closed or using `fcntl`
- In addition, we have `execlp`, `execle`, `execv`, `execvp`, `execve`
  - `l` means list, `v` mean array (variadic vs array args)
  - `e` means it takes a new environment
  - `p` means it seaches the PATH for the filename

```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int pid = fork();
    if(pid == -1) {
        perror("fork"); return 1;
    }
    if(pid == 0) { //child
        int ret;
        ret = execlp("ls", "ls", NULL);
        if (ret == -1) {
            perror("exec"); return 1;
        }
    } else {
        printf("Parent\\n");
    }

}
```
