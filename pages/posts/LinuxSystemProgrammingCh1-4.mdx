#### Chapter 1 - Introduction

- processes inherit the UID and GID
- permission octal values: r=4, w=2, x=1. Order is user, group, everyone else
- functions normally just return a -1 to indicate an error
- more details to be found in `extern int errno` in `<errno.h>`
- to print `void perror(const char *str)` in `<stdio.h>`
- example:

```c
if (close (fd) == −1)
        perror ("close");
```

#### Chapter 2 - File I/O

- Opening files: 
```c
fd = open(<path>, flags)
```
- create: 
```c
fd = open (file, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0664);
```
- is identical to 
```c
fd = creat (filename, 0644);
```
- fd of -1 indicates error
- reading:
```c
#include <unistd.h>
ssize_t read (int fd, void *buf, size_t len);
```
- A call to read() can result in many possibilitie, to read all the bytes
```c
ssize_t ret;
while (len != 0 && (ret = read (fd, buf, len)) != 0) {
  if (ret == −1) {
    if (errno == EINTR)
      continue;
    perror ("read");
    break;
  }
  len -= ret;
  buf += ret;
}
```
- nonblocking reads can be achieved by passing O_NONBLOCK to `open`
- if a read is blocked, it will return -1 and errno will be set to EAGAIN
- write:
```c
#include <unistd.h>
ssize_t write (int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
```
- call fsync(int ft) to sync writes to storage
- fdatasync(int fd) does the same thing, without updated metadata, and is faster
- use the O_SYNC flag to always sync
- closing:
```c
#include <unistd.h>
int close(int fd)`
```
- seeking:
```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
off_t lseek (int fd, off_t pos, int origin);
```
- you CAN seek past the end of a file, it will be padded with zeros
- position reads and writes avoid the race condtion associated with seeking and then reading
```c
#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 500
#include <unistd.h>
ssize_t pread (int fd, void *buf, size_t count, off_t pos);
ssize_t pwrite (int fd, const void *buf, size_t count, off_t pos);
```
##### Multiplexed IO
- `poll()` is easier to use than `select()`
- both wait on a set of open file descriptors and return when any are available
- poll example
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <poll.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
		struct pollfd fds[2];
		fds[0].fd = STDIN_FILENO;
		fds[0].events = POLLIN;
		
		fds[1].fd = STDOUT_FILENO;
		fds[1].events = POLLOUT;

		int err = poll(fds, (nfds_t) 2, 0);
		if (err == -1) {
			perror("poll");
			return -1;
		}
		
		if (fds[0].revents & POLLIN) {
			printf("STDIN ready\\n");
		}
		if (fds[1].revents & POLLOUT) {
			printf("STDOUT ready\\n");
		}
		
		return 0;
}
```
- The VFS provides a unified blocks and inodes based interface to all filesystems
- The page cache holds retrieved info including readaheads

### Chapter 3 - Buffered I/O
- Usually more efficient to read in multiples of 4096 or 8192 bytes because of block alignment
- User space buffered IO can increase performance even more
- Write to a buffer, which is written in a single operation
- The read requests are served from the buffer
- The end result is fewer system calls for larger amounts of data, all aligned on block boundaries.
- Provided by `stdio`
- StardardI/O routines act on file pointers, not fds
- `FILE` type defined in `stdio.h`
```c
FILE * fopen (const char *path, const char *mode);
FILE * fdopen (int fd, const char *mode);
```
- modes: r, w, r+ (read+write), w+ (read, write, truncates), a+(rw in append mode)
- Closing the stream will close the file descriptor as well.
```c
int fclose (FILE *stream);
int fcloseall (void); // Linux specific
```
- reading
```c
// read a char
int fgetc (FILE *stream); 
// put it back
int ungetc (int c, FILE *stream); 
// read a line
// reads one char less than size and puts a \0 at the end
// will stop and newline and also put a \n
char * fgets (char *str, int size, FILE *stream); 
// Read binary data
// reads `nr` elements, each of size `size`
// returns less than nr if there's an error
// it is impossible to know which of the two conditions occurred without using ferror() and feof()
size_t fread (void *buf, size_t size, size_t nr, FILE *stream);
```
- writing
```c
// write a char
// return EOF in case of error
int fputc (int c, FILE *stream);
// write a string
int fputs (const char *str, FILE *stream);
// binary
// A return value less than nr denotes error.
size_t fwrite (void *buf, size_t size, size_t nr, FILE *stream);
```
- It’s important to bear in mind that because of differences in variable sizes, align‐
ment, and so on, binary data written with one application may not be readable by other
applications.
- Example program
```c

# include <stdio.h>

int main(int arc, char **argv) {
	struct pirate {
			char name[100];
			unsigned long booty;
			unsigned int beard_len;
	} p, blackbeard = {"Mayank", 100, 50};
	
	FILE * file = fopen("/tmp/pirate", "w");
	if (!file) {
		perror("fopen");
		return 1;
	}
	if(!fwrite(&blackbeard, sizeof (struct pirate), 1, file)){
		perror("fwrite");
		return 1;
	}
	if(fclose(file)) {
		perror("fclose");
		return 1;
	}

	file = fopen("/tmp/pirate", "r");
	if (!file) {
		perror("fopen");
		return 1;
	}
	if(!fread(&p, sizeof(struct pirate), 1, file)) {
		perror("fread"); return 1;
	}
	if(fclose(file)) {
		perror("fclose");
		return 1;
	}
	printf("%s, %lu, %u", p.name, p.booty, p.beard_len);
}
```
- other
```c
int fseek (FILE *stream, long offset, int whence);
// fsetpos, rewind, ftell, fgetpos for seeking
// fflush flushes the data to the kernel (but does not sync)
fileno(*stream) gets the fd
```
- errors
```c
ferror(FILE *stream) returns non-zero if error is set
feof() returns nonzero if EOF is set
clearerr() clears the error
```
##### Threading
- Standard io functions are thread safe
- For multipl functions, use explicit locks
```c
flockfile(*stream) locks a file (blocking) by incrementing lock count
funlockfile(*stream) decrements lock count
ftrylockfile(*stream) is non-blocking, returning nonzero if cannot lock
```

#### Chapter 4: Advanced File I/O
##### Scatter/Gather I/O
- The idea is to write several buffers to a file or to read several buffers from a file
- The buffers are read and written in serial order, but very efficiently by the kernel
```c
#include <sys/uio.h>
struct iovec {
  void *iov_base;
  size_t iov_len;
};
ssize_t readv (int fd, const struct iovec *iov, int count);
ssize_t writev (int fd, const struct iovec *iov, int count);
```
##### epoll
- easier to use than `poll` and `select`, but linux specific 
- decouples creating a listener, adding fds and waiting on it
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/epoll.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main() {
    int epfd = epoll_create1(0);
    struct epoll_event events[2];
    events[0].events = EPOLLIN;
    events[0].data.fd = STDIN_FILENO;
    events[1].events = EPOLLOUT;
    events[1].data.fd = STDOUT_FILENO;
    if(epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, STDIN_FILENO, &events[0]) == -1) {
        perror("epoll_ctl");
        return 1;
    }
    if(epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, STDOUT_FILENO, &events[1]) == -1) {
        perror("epoll_ctl");
        return 1;
    }

    struct epoll_event out_events[2];
    int events_ready = epoll_wait(epfd, out_events, 2, 0);
    if(events_ready == -1) {
        perror("epoll_wait");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Events Ready: %d\\n", events_ready);
    for(int i = 0; i < events_ready; i++) {
        printf("Event fd: %i: %i\\n", out_events[i].events, out_events[i].data.fd);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

##### MMAP

- mmap maps a file into memory
```c
#include <sys/mman.h>
void * mmap (void *addr, size_t len, int prot, int flags, int fd, off_t offset);
```
- `prot` is protection mode - `PROT_READ`, `PROT_WRITE`, `PROT_EXEC`
- it should match the open mode of the file
- flags:
  - MAX_FIXED - addr is a requirement, not optional (discouraged)
  - MAP_PRIVATE - file is mapped copy-on-write
  - MAP_SHARED - shared with other processes that map this file
  - one of the previous two must be specified, but not both
- mapping increments the file's reference counter
- `addr` and `offset` must be aligned on a page boundary
- to get page size
```c
long page_size = sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE); // <unistd.h>
// or
int getpagesize(void);
```
- to remove mapping:
```c
int munmap(void *arrd, size_t len);
```
- will remove all mappings in the given range
- example
```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

    if (argc != 2) {
        printf("Must suppy filename\\n"); return 1;
    }

    int fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
    if (fd == -1) {
        perror("open"); return 1;
    }

    struct stat sb;

    if (fstat(fd, &sb) == -1) {
        perror("fstat"); return 1;
    }

    if (!S_ISREG(sb.st_mode)) {
        printf("Not a regular file\\n"); return 1;
    }

    char * p;
    if ((p = mmap(0, sb.st_size, PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0)) == MAP_FAILED) {
        perror("mmap"); return 1;
    }

    for(int i = 0; i < sb.st_size; i++) {
        putchar(*(p + i));
    }
    putchar('\\n');

    if(munmap(p, sb.st_size) == -1) {
        perror("munmap"); return 1;
    }

    return 0;

}
```
- advantages of mmap:
  - avoids the extra copy that happens to a user space buffer when using `read` and `write`
  - there's no system call overhead to read from memory
  - shared mode lets processes share file
  - there's no need for lseek
- `mremap` to change size of mapping
- glib often uses `mremap` to implement `realloc`
- `mprotect` to change protection of a mapping
- `msync` to sync changes back to disk
	- should always be called because kernel does not know that memory has been modified, unlike `write`'s dirty buffers
- `madvise` to give the kernel a hint about usage of map
	- usually related to amount of readahead (more for sequential, none for random)
- `posix_fadvise` is very similar, but for normal I/O (not mmap)

##### Asynchronous I/O

- The book here is very brief. The following notes are from the aio(7) man page

- The POSIX AIO interface consists of the following functions:
```c
#include <aiocb.h>

aio_read(3)     Enqueue a read request.  This is the asynchronous analog of read(2).
aio_write(3)    Enqueue a write request.  This is the asynchronous analog of write(2).
aio_fsync(3)    Enqueue a sync request for the I/O operations on a file descriptor.  This is the asynchronous analog of fsync(2) and fdatasync(2).
aio_error(3)    Obtain the error status of an enqueued I/O request.
aio_return(3)   Obtain the return status of a completed I/O request.
aio_suspend(3)  Suspend the caller until one or more of a specified set of I/O requests completes.
aio_cancel(3)   Attempt to cancel outstanding I/O requests on a specified file descriptor.
lio_listio(3)   Enqueue multiple I/O requests using a single function call.


struct aiocb {
	int             aio_fildes;     /* File descriptor */
	off_t           aio_offset;     /* File offset */
	volatile void  *aio_buf;        /* Location of buffer */
	size_t          aio_nbytes;     /* Length of transfer */
	int             aio_reqprio;    /* Request priority */
	struct sigevent aio_sigevent;   /* Notification method */
	int             aio_lio_opcode; /* Operation to be performed;
};
```
- You can either poll the status of the request (with `aio_error`) or have the completion fire a signal
- You can ask the request to signal via `aiocbp->aio_sigevent.sigev_notify = SIGEV_SIGNAL`
- You can also ask it to spawn a thread 
- If `aio_error` is not EINPROGRESS, you can use `aio_return` to get the return value (of the corresponding `read()` operation for example)

##### I/O Schedulers and I/O performance
- Scheduler is set in `/sys/block/[device]/queue/scheduler`
- The scheduler would try to sequence reads and writes on disk efficiently
- It performs merges (combining reads in adjecent blocks) and sorting
- Since writes are streamed (async), they can starve the reads (`writes-starving-reads`)
- The Deadline scheduler 
  - keeps a sorted list of operations (sorted by physical block)
  - keeps a FIFO queue of read operations and a FIFO queue of write operations
  - read ops have a deadline of 500ms and write ops 6s
  - it goes by sorted list, unless a deadline happens, which get priority

- My current machine with an NMVe SSD disc uses mq-deadline (multiqueue)


##### Optimizing IO
- There are many optimizations that can be done on the application side:
  - Minimize I/O operations (coalescing)
  - Perform block aligned I/O
  - Use buffering
  - vectored I/O, positional I/O and async I/O
- We can also sort I/O requests before sending them to the kernel
  - Sectors are mapped to physical blocks so block storage can be addressed by blocks (logical block addressing, LBA) instead of cylinders, heads and sectors
  - Filesystems are purely software, and talk in terms of logical blocks
  - Logical block size is a multiple of physical block size
- Sorting writes in the application:
  - One way to do that is pathname -> poor approximation
  - Another is inode number -> breaks with more fragmentation
  - Or you can try to sort by physical block:
    - Each file is broken into logical blocks
    - You can get the physical block from logical block:
    ```c
      ret = ioctl (fd, FIBMAP, &block);
    ```
    - The logical blocks are zero-indexed and file-relative 
    - First determine number of blocks in a file via `fstat`
    - Then, for each logical block, find the physical block via `ioctl`
    - Since files tend to be contiguous and we will mostly want to order I/O for a given file, just use the 0th block to sort:
    ```c
    int logical_block = 0;
    ioctl(fd, FIBMAP, &logical_block);
    ```
